1.Yes, they show the same information because in Repeatable read the transaction was not commited and it sees only the data that was read initially.
2.After commiting transaction in 2nd terminal it shows changed data.
3.The repeatable read has the data that was read at the start of transaction, therefore it does not see the changes in terminal 1 and will output the initial Alice's balance + 20.

2)
First two reads in T1 will be equal, because T2 was not commited and the isolation level is Read Commited. So the general result is that al people from group 2 except Bob will receive 15, and Bob gets the second group
